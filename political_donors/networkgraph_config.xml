		<!-- the type of interface used to load graph data. currently

		   -
		   - the 'static_xml' interface mode simply loads an XML file
		   - containing graph data from the given URL.  this is the
		   - simplest interface but all the data is loaded before the
		   - visualization is displayed, it is not suitable for large
		   - datasets
		   -
		   - the 'rest_tree' interface mode loads data dynamically from
		   - a REST-like web service.  the client sends the ID of a node
		   - and the server responds with the nodes and edges contained
		   - in a tree rooted at that node. more information about
		   - implementing the interface is available at the
		   - Constellation website
		   -->
		<interface_mode>static_xml</interface_mode>
		
		<!-- the URL where the graph data is loaded.  when the request
		   - is made, the following strings will be replaced with
		   - variable values:
		   -
		   - [instance_id]  - the chart ID passed to the Constellation
		   -                  Chart instance in the flash_vars
		   - [node_id]   - the ID of the node being loaded
		   - [depth]     - the depth of the tree to load from the server
		   - [timestamp] - the current unix timestamp.  use to break caching
		   -->
		<url>http://localhost/lobbylens/public_html/political_donors/political_donors.xml.php</url>
		
		<!-- the depth of the tree to load from the server. in any tree
		   - interface mode, the client will request a tree of this
		   - depth.  ensure that the value of 'load_depth' is not lower
		   - than 'min_load_depth'
		   -->
		<load_depth>5</load_depth>
		
		<!-- the depth of the selected node's tree that must be loaded.
		   - in any tree interface mode, when a node is selected, the
		   - client will ensure that all the nodes in the tree of this
		   - depth and rooted at the selected node will be loaded.  for
		   - example, if node A is selected and the load ahead depth is
		   - 2, then the client will check whether node A's neighbours
		   - have been loaded.  if not, it will request the information
		   - from the server.
		   -
		   - the depth value includes the selected node.  so a value of
		   - 1 will only require that the selected node is loaded.  a
		   - value of 2 will require that the selected node and its
		   - neighbours are loaded.  a value of 3 will require the
		   - selected node, its neighbours, and their neighbours.
