fixes:
send email on XML parsing exception!!!!

drill down for nodes
- Display time span period of information where dollar values appear

neo-locale view
- group by state rather than postcode

Update to November 1st 2009+ tender data
Radical Right overlay - http://unbelief.org/groups/
Resize network graph to fit screen using javascript http://www.kaali.co.uk/index.pl?art=94

Political donations viewer
- Put values on the links not the nodes
- change weight of links based on amount

Search - http://www.brandspankingnew.net/specials/ajax_autosuggest/ajax_autosuggest_autocomplete.html?
	- hidden field for "type" eg supplier, lobbyist; can be used to signify that has been autosuggested
	- else search.php returns all matches
	- smart logic for digit input (abn, postcode) vs. string (name)

link suppliers that are also gov agencies (like crimtrac, centerlink CPM) properly

avoid duplication of links for every API backend
- fix node duplication detection to use xquery

Add LobbYAML 1.0 schema to about screen - include state sources field, ABN etc
- Add LobbYAML API.


network graph/UX improvements:
	
A legend of colors

Color edges of graph?
Display lobbyists on agency graph
Highlight government supplier lobbyist clients in a different color

AJAX "drop in" search. Add nodes to an existing graph and see if there is a connection
Filter nodes? Allow disabling of postcodes/categories?
go "back" in graph. use javascript events to record breadcrumbs
Collapse nodes again?
Help lightbox/popup for beginning users with examples
- popup by default on first load
Screen export as bitmap?


future gazing:
Use Gini coefficient for income disparity of suppliers?
Include stimulus projects - http://data.australia.gov.au/52
Use more advanced graph interface? JViz? RGraph?
SNA tools like http://igraph.sourceforge.net/ (has python interface!)
